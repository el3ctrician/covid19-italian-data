# COVID-19 Italian Data Plots  

This project provides basic statistics and visualizations of COVID-19 data in Italy using data from the Dipartimento della Protezione Civile (DPC).  

I am an Electronics Engineer, not a data scientist. This project is my personal effort to monitor trends and stay informed about the situation.  

An interactive and *almost* always-updated version of these plots is available [here](https://ahmadelbadri.com/covid19-italian-data/).  

## 📂 Website Code
